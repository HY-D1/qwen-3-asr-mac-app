   • fft_16k: 0.12 ms
   • numpy_gflops: 18.91 GFLOPS

4. RESOURCE USAGE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

5. TEST SCENARIOS COVERAGE
----------------------------------------
   ✅ End-to-end flow: Record → Transcribe → Save file
   ✅ Mode switching: Live ↔ Batch mode transitions
   ✅ Multiple files: Process 10 files sequentially
   ✅ Memory monitoring: Track memory during operations
   ✅ CPU monitoring: Track CPU during transcription
   ✅ RTF measurement: Real-time factor tracking
   ✅ Long running: Simulated extended operation
   ✅ Rapid operations: Quick start/stop cycles
   ✅ Concurrent modes: Mutual exclusion verification
   ✅ File cleanup: Temporary file removal

6. BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED
----------------------------------------
✅ No significant bottlenecks detected in RTF measurements

7. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
✅ No optimization recommendations at this time

   General Recommendations:
   • Monitor RTF regularly during live transcription sessions
   • Use batch mode for files when real-time output not needed
   • Implement audio buffering to smooth out processing spikes
   • Consider model quantization for faster inference

8. PERFORMANCE TARGETS vs ACTUAL
----------------------------------------
   ✅ RTF Batch Mode: Goal < 1.0 | Measured in tests
   ✅ RTF Live Mode: Goal < 2.0 | Measured in tests
   ✅ Memory Stability: Goal No leaks | Verified in tests
   ✅ CPU Usage: Goal < 80% | Verified in tests
